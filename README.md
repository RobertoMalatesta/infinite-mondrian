[Infinite Mondrian](http://infinitemondrian.com)
================================================
*"By virtue of the grid, [Mondrian's work] is presented as a mere fragment, a tiny piece arbitrarily cropped from an infinitely larger fabric." â€”Krauss. Infinite Mondrian marries the infinity supposed by computation and Mondrian.*

Infinite Mondrian is a multi-platform (desktop, mobile, desktop+mobile, [Google Cardboard VR](https://www.google.com/get/cardboard/)) web experiment that utilizes WebGL ([THREE.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js)), WebRTC ([PeerJS](https://github.com/peers/peerjs)), and other new web API (gyroscope, device-orientation, fullscreen, pointerlock, etc.) to create a procedurally generated 3D world that resembles a Mondrian painting. Infinite Mondrian allows users to create their own "Mondrian painting" by taking a picture of a cross section of this infinite world then claim it as their own to share it with the social media world.

## Usage
* On a desktop: use mouse to navigate the world, and keyboard keys to manipulate the camera (letters on the button below instructions).
* On a mobile device: use the phone's gyroscope to navigate the world.
* On a desktop + mobile: Open the app on a desktop, and access the url under *Use a Remote Controller* on a mobile device (use another tab to test if unavailable). The mobile device will remotely control the app on desktop; its gyroscope will navigate the world, the buttons on the mobile device will manipulate the camera. Requires Android (maybe one day other platform will support WebRTC).
* On a Google Cardboard: On a mobile device, access the app and click the enable button. Make sure the device is in landscape mode.

## Running your own
1. Download the files: `$ git clone https://github.com/jssolichin/infinite-mondrian`
2. Install dependencies: `$ npm install; bower install`.
4. Edit [public/js/config.js](public/js/config.js) and change host and port as necessary. Default should work fine on local machine.
4. Run the app: `$ node app.js`.
